It has survived - not only (five) centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining 3+4*2 unchanged!
    It was popularised in the 5*(1+2) with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages.

    It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
    The point of using (-71+(2+3)/(3*(2+1/2+2)-2)/10+2)/7 Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters?

    It is a (7+5*12*(2+5-2))/12 established fact that a reader will be of a page when looking at its layout...

    Bye.
